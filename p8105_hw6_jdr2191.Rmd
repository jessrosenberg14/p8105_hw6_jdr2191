```

## Problem 1

Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).
```{r import_data}
birthweight_df = 
  read_csv("birthweight.csv") %>%
  mutate(babysex = factor(babysex, levels = c(1,2))) %>%
  mutate(frace = factor(frace, levels = c(1,2,3,4,8,9))) %>%
  mutate(malform = factor(malform, levels = c(0,1))) %>%
  mutate(mrace = factor(mrace, levels = c(1,2,3,4,8)))
```
